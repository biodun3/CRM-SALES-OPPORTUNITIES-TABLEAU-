<h1>CRM+SALES+OPPORTUNITY(TABLEAU)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Using the same data file i used in excel, this project visually analyse some important informations using Tableau. I created a dashboard that analysed different informations at a go.
<br />


<h2>Data tools used</h2>

- <b>Tableau and Excel</b> 

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>
</b>
  After the filtering and sorting of data using excel as clearly explained in the excel project. I imported the file into tableau and then use the data to visually analyse the following informations using a dashboard:
<br />
1) Total close value for all sales agent in every account. To know how well each sales agents are performing under every account </b>
<br />
2) Account with more than or equal to 30 lost opportunity in each region. To know the account that is having the most lost opportunity under every region  </b>
<br />
3) How many won, lost, still engaging and prospecting opportunity under each account  </b>
<br />
4) Most successful agent under each account  </b>
<br />
5) Number of opportunity responded to between 1-5days for every account in each region  </b>
<br />
<br />
I created a chart to analyse each of the problem listed, then created a dashboard from it. Below are all the charts with a clear guide on how all the charts are created: </b>
